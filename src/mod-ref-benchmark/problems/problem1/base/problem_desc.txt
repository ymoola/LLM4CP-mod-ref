A number of cars are to be produced; they are not identical, because different options are available as variants on the basic model. 
The assembly line has different stations which install the various options (air-conditioning, sunroof, etc.). 
These stations have been designed to handle at most a certain percentage of  the cars passing along the assembly line. Furthermore, the cars requiring a certain option must not be bunched together, otherwise the station will not be able to cope. 
Consequently, the cars must be arranged in a sequence so that the capacity of each station is never exceeded. 
For instance, if a particular station can only cope with at most half of the cars passing along the line, the sequence must be built so that at most 1 car in any 2 requires that option.  
Print the sequence of car types in the assembly line (sequence); each car type is represented by a number starting from 0.

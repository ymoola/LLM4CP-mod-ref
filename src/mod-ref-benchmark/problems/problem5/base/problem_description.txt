The N-Fractions Puzzle is defined as follows: find nine distinct non-zero digits
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I such that the following equation holds:

      A       D       G
     ---  +  ---  +  ---  =  1
      BC      EF      HI

where BC denotes the two-digit number 10·B + C, EF denotes 10·E + F, 
and HI denotes 10·H + I.

All nine digits must be distinct and drawn from {1,…,9}. The goal is simply
to find a valid assignment of digits satisfying the equation;

  "content": "Extend the Warehouse Location Problem by adding a revenue value for each store. Instead of minimizing total cost, the objective becomes maximizing profit, defined as total revenue from assigned stores minus the fixed cost of opening warehouses and the supply costs. All original feasibility constraints must still hold: each store must be supplied by exactly one warehouse, warehouses can only supply stores if opened, and warehouse capacity limits must be respected.",

  "content": "Warehouses can now operate in an optional expanded mode. Each warehouse j has a normal capacity capacities[j] and an expanded capacity capacity_expanded[j]. Activating expanded mode requires setting a binary variable upgrade[j] = 1, which adds upgrade_cost[j] to the objective. When upgrade[j] = 0, the warehouse operates at normal capacity; when upgrade[j] = 1, its capacity increases accordingly. All stores must still be supplied by a single open warehouse, and the objective now minimizes supply cost, warehouse opening cost, and the cost of expansions.",

Bus driver scheduling can be formulated as a set paritioning problem. We propose 12 set partitioning problems derived from small bus driver scheduling problems. These consist of a given set of tasks (pieces of work) to cover and a large set of possible shifts, where each shift covers a subset of the tasks and has an associated cost. We must select a subset of possible shifts that covers each piece of work once and only once: this is called a partition. Further, In the driver scheduling (unlike air crew scheduling) the main aim is to reduce the number of shifts used in the solution partition and the total cost of the partition is secondary. To simplify the problem we have made the cost of each shift the same. This means that the goal is to minimise the number of shifts.

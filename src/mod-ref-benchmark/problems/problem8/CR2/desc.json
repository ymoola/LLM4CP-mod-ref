  "content": "Certain precedence relations now carry a maximum allowed delay. For each specified constrained precedence (i, j), the successor activity j must start no later than a given maximum delay after activity i finishes. All original precedence and resource-capacity constraints remain in force, and the objective remains to minimize project completion time.",

In the Blocks World problem, we are given a set of blocks arranged in piles and must
transform a start configuration into a goal configuration using the shortest possible
sequence of moves. A move selects one free block (a block with nothing on top of it)
and places it either on the table or on top of another free block.

At most k piles may be used at any time, so the number of blocks that can be directly
on the table is limited by k. Both the start and goal configurations are represented by
an array where entry b indicates what block block b+1 is resting on (0 means table).

The aim is to minimize the number of moves needed to transform the start
configuration into the goal configuration while respecting the move rules and
the maximum number of piles.
